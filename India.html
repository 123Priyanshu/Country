    <div>India is made of many different wonders in the world. You can find so many things in India. The food of India
        is
        a whole differnt story. People from all over the world to see so many sigths in India. One of those sigths is
        the Taj Mahal.
        The Taj Mahal is a dome that is located in Agra, India. The dome is made up of ivory marble from top to bottom
        and doesn't really have such a big lighting system as far as recent searches have been done. One reason why th
        eTaj Mahal is visited is because of it's reason of building. The reason the Taj Mahal was built was because the
        king, Shan Jahan, wanted his wife to be happy before she left the world. The second reason is because the Taj
        Mahal is actually one of the seven wonders of the world.</div>
